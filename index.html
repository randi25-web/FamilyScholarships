            <img src="images/ConniePerdreau.jpg" alt="Connie_Perdreau" class="float-image">
            <p>The United Martin Family Scholarship Program was established by <a href="pdfs/Professor_Cornelia.pdf">Professor Connie Perdreau</a> in 1993 when she announced its inception at the UMF Reunion in Columbus, Ohio, on the occasion of its 25th Silver Anniversary, when she was the keynote speaker. The first scholarships were awarded in 1997. Since that time, more than $100,000 in scholarships have been awarded to over 100 undergraduate and graduate students in our family.</p>
            <p>The program is open to UMF students who are descendants of Trasie, and are starting college or are enrolled in a graduate degree program in Medicine or Masterâ€™s in Business Administration, the latter being the Malverse Martin Sr. Graduate Scholarship.</p>
